# ZIGlands: A Bizarre Adventure in Zig Programming

ZIGlands is an educational project.

Each example in ZIGlands tackles a specific Zig concept, explaining it through analogies to Stand abilities, Hamon techniques, or iconic moments from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The project is organized into volumes, each containing a set of themed examples.


## Volumes

### [Volume 1: Phantom Code](volume-1/README.md)

The inaugural volume of ZIGlands, introducing fundamental Zig concepts through the lens of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Dive into memory management, error handling, concurrency, and more, all explained with the flair of a Stand battle!

## How to Use ZIGlands

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Zig installed (version 0.13.0 or later recommended).
3. Navigate to a volume (e.g., `cd volume-1`).
4. Explore the examples in the `examples/` directory.
5. Read the README.md files for explanations and JoJo references.
6. Compile and run the .zig files to see the concepts in action.

## Contributing

Your next line is... "I want to contribute to ZIGlands!" I welcome contributions from both Zig enthusiasts and JoJo fans. If you have an idea for a new example, a correction, or an improvement, please feel free to submit a PR.

Remember, coding in Zig is like manifesting a Stand - it takes practice, creativity, and a bizarre approach to problem-solving.
